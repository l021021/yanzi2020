The yanzi geojson format is an extension to the common geoJSON format to add typing and naming information in a standardized way.
The Yanzi format specifies three requirements.

1: Stable ID requirement
1.1 All features representing a room, area, chair, table, conference room etc. MUST have the top level "id" key set to a globally(within location) unique string.
1.2 The id must be stable when the model is updated.

2. Known type requirement
2.1 All features with an ID and all features supposed to be rendered (walls, etc) must have a property named "type" with one of the known types in the table below.

3. Floor polygon
3.1 There must exist a feature that is a polygon or multipolygon and has the floor type.

Fields defined by the yanzi standard:
...
{
  "type":"Feature",
  "id":"181a32b8-1fb0-402e-9d96-5011e4bdc6a7", // Example unique id
  "geometry": ...
  "properties":{
    "type": "area.room.conference", // Required (see 2.1)
    "name": "Conference Room Saturnus", // Optional, recommended
    "address": "1R13", // Optional
    "parent": "261a12b8-1fb0-404e-9d06-5011e4bd11f9" // Optional
  }
}

Supported types:
area                     Abstract topclass for any type of area
area.floor               The background polygon.
area.room                A generic room
area.room.bathroom       A bathroom
area.room.conference     A conference room
area.hallway             A hallway
area.section             Open area, rendered with different color. If exist, render this section in this color with no border.
area.inaccessible        An inaccessible area

fixture.door             A door
fixture.elevator         An elevator
fixture.stairs           Stairs
fixture.step             A single step polygon
fixture.wall             A wall
fixture.wall.partition   A partition (rendered as line)
fixture.tv               A tv

furniture.chair          A chair
furniture.desk           A desk
furniture.counter        A countertop
furniture.table          A table

# A poi(point of interest) is a single point that will be rendered with an icon.
poi.printer              A printer
poi.entrance             A building/floor entrance

poi.device.sensor               A placed or planned sensor


Parent reference
A polygon might optionally indicate a hierarical parent through the parent property. The value of the property must be the ID of another feature in this geojson file.
The parent should be the immidiate parent. For instance, the hierarical parent of a "furniture.chair" might be a specific "area.room.conference".
If the parent is not specified, implementations might calculate hierarchies from the geometries in the file.

Extended properties for poi.device.sensor
The poi.device.sensor type is used by Yanzi to indicate positions of planned or placed sensors. The following additional properties is understood by the format parser.
All poi.* types MUST be a point geometry.
...
{
  "type":"Feature",
  "id":"181a32b8-1fb0-402e-9d96-5011e4bdc6a7", // Example unique id
  "geometry": ... // Must be a point
  "properties":{
    "type": "poi.device.sensor", // Required (see 2.1)
    "name": "Presidential bedroom moisture sensor 4",
    "parent": "181a32b8-1fb0-402e-9d96-5011e4bdc6a5", // Optional
    ...

    // Extended props
    "typeprops": {
      "productType": "00414CDA", // Yanzi product type number
    },

    // These key values will be imported as-is into the custom properties of the unit.
    // Values must be strings.
    "custom": {
      "key": "value"
    }
  }
}
